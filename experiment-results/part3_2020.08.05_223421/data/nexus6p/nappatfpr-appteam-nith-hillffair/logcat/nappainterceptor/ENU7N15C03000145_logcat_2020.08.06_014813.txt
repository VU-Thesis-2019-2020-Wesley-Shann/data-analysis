We act as a binding force between all the clubs during Hillfair. Team PR handles every detail, managing the stage being one of the major responsibilites. PR is also responsible for inviting all the dignitaries and celebrities to the college fest. We publicize the fest to every nook and corner of student fraternity (both online and offline). Team PR also conducts the very own pageant of our college known as 'Adam and Eve'. We also host a much sought after event in the college - 'Prom Night'.
