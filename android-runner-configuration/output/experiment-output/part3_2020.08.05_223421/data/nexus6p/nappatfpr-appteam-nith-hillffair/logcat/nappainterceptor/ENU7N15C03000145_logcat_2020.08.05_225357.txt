Being a part of technical club of NIT-H is an excellent way to meet new challenges and introduce yourself to new experiences and opportunities that will surely be helpful in the future.\n\nIt won’t be inappropriate to say that technical club is perhaps the backbone of Hillffair.\n\nWe manage all the technical stuff without which it is impossible to even think about a successful cultural fest. We manage the audio-video ,projector, screens and synchronization of various teams and events during hillffair.\n\nBut our work is not only confined to the 3 days of hillffair. Actual work of team technical starts about a month before hillffair. By being with Team Technical one can learn photoshop for photo editing, premier pro for video editing, after effect for video making and wondershare for slide show to name some.\n"},"success":true,"msg":"Loaded Successfully"}

Being a part of technical club of NIT-H is an excellent way to meet new challenges and introduce yourself to new experiences and opportunities that will surely be helpful in the future.\n\nIt won’t be inappropriate to say that technical club is perhaps the backbone of Hillffair.\n\nWe manage all the technical stuff without which it is impossible to even think about a successful cultural fest. We manage the audio-video ,projector, screens and synchronization of various teams and events during hillffair.\n\nBut our work is not only confined to the 3 days of hillffair. Actual work of team technical starts about a month before hillffair. By being with Team Technical one can learn photoshop for photo editing, premier pro for video editing, after effect for video making and wondershare for slide show to name some.\n"},"success":true,"msg":"Loaded Successfully"}
