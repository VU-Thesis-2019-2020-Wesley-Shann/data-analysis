It confirms what we all suspected but what I secretly hoped wasn&#x27;t true.<p>Intel for over a decade coyly hinted they had aces up their sleeves that would already have been played if they faced more competition.  Graphene got kicked around in conversations for a while and then when that turned out to be a no go they talked about black phosphorus.<p>So after all that, aside from marginal tweaks and pretty meager die shrinks here and there, they were doing.. nothing?.. for <i>ten years</i>?","time":1595916380,"type":"comment"}

It would be a mistake to cede this capacity to outsourcing like so much of our other manufacturing capacity. Interestingly, it seems the US is almost unique in our mass deindustrialization.

Done. Permanently.<p>I couldn&#x27;t believe anyone could think this was a good idea.","time":1595904352,"type":"comment"}

Shut down the factory and outsource to China, and you have the same sales with a lot less capital, so the stock goes up. Great success.<p>Maybe repeat by having your suppliers do more and more of the engineering. At a certain point, you are just a brand, with no actual engineering capability.<p>You can&#x27;t compete with the people who actually know how to make the things. Then you die. See Hewlett Packard.<p>The US taxing companies on global income at high rates also has an effect. Say you have 50% of your sales outside the US. You pay taxes in the country where you sell the product. Then you have profits overseas. If you bring that cash back to the US, you pay the difference between the corporate rate in country X and the US, which can be a lot, say 15%. \nMight as well take that money and use it to pay for manufacturing at e.g. Foxconn. So it&#x27;s 15% better to invest in manufacturing capacity outside the US.<p>The poor health care system in the US drives up costs as well, twice what it is in other industrialized countries for  worse outcome. Same for cost of housing because zoning laws won&#x27;t allow building. Google was allowed to build offices in Mountain View but not residential property for the employees to live in. So everyone has to commute from somewhere else, and cost of rent is driven by how much misery you can handle.<p>Failures in government policy make US workers much more expensive without creating any more value or improving the quality of life for the employees.","time":1595905876,"type":"comment"}

It would be a mistake to cede this capacity to outsourcing like so much of our other manufacturing capacity. Interestingly, it seems the US is almost unique in our mass deindustrialization.
